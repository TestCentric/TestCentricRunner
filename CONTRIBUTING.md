# How to contribute

So you're thinking about contributing to TestCentric? Great! Maintaining and enhancing the TestCentric GUI is a big job, so **the community's help is really appreciated.**

Helping out isn't just writing code, it also includes submitting issues, helping confirm issues, writing documentation, running tests and answering questions from other users. 

## Submitting Issues

Requests for new features and bug reports keep the project moving forward.

### Before you submit an issue

- Ensure you are running the [latest version](https://github.com/TestCentric/testcentric-gui/releases) of TestCentric.

- **Search** the [issue list](https://github.com/TestCentric/testcentric-gui/issues) to make sure it hasn't already been reported. Be sure to look at closed issues as well as open ones, in case there is a fix available already.
- If in doubt about whether to report a GUI issue or an NUnit issue, you can try running the same tests using the NUnit console runner.
- Report TestCentric issues [here](https://github.com/TestCentric/testcentric-gui/issues). Report NUnit issues [here](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues).

### Submitting a good issue

- Give the issue a short, clear title that describes the bug or feature request.
- Include the version of TestCentric you are using as well as the NUnit version.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue
- If possible, include a short code example that reproduces the issue
- Use [markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) as appropriate to make the issue and code more readable.

## Confirming Issues

Before we work on issues, we must confirm them and be able to reproduce them. Confirming issues takes up a great deal of the team's time, so making that job easier is **really appreciated**.

Issues that need confirmation will have the **confirm** label or be unlabeled and have **no milestone**. You can help us to confirm issues by;

- Adding steps to reproduce the issue
- Creating unit tests to demonstrate the issue
- Testing issues created by others and adding a comment as feedback

## Documentation

Great documentation is essential for any open source project and TestCentric is no exception. [Our documentation](https://github.com/TestCentric/testcentric-gui/wiki/) may sometimes lag behind the features that have been implemented or may benefit from better examples.

A great place to start is by going through the Release Notes on GitHub and ensuring that the documentation for new features is up to date.

## Fixing Bugs and Adding Features

We love pull requests! We prefer that new contributors start with small issues and let us know before contributing code so as to prevent duplication of work.

To help new contributors get their feet wet, we have marked a number of issues with the `easyfix` label. These are great places to start.

It is also a good idea to add a comment to an issue that you are working on to let everyone know. We'll assign the issue to you so that it shows up under your name on GitHub. If you stop working on it, also please let us know.

Please read through the developer section of the documentation before contributing to understand our coding standards and contribution guidelines.

Once you are ready to have your work reviewed, create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub. A team member will review it and may make suggestions for changes. Only team members (committers) are able to merge your work into TestCentric.
