TestCentric Runner for NUnit 1.0.0 - July 27, 2019

General

This is the final release of version 1.0 of the TestCentric Runner for NUnit, which is
primarily based on the layout and feature set of the original NUnit V2 GUI runner with
internals modified so as to run NUnit3 tests. Certain changes were made because of 
differences in how NUnit3 works and are described below under Features.

This new GUI runner was created by the TestCentric team: Charlie Poole, Mikkel Bundgaard,
Manfred Lange, Stefano Nuzzo and Robert Snyder. Community members who contributed code to
this release include Jeff Kryzer, zBrianW, Joseph Musser and Mattias Karlsson. Countless
other folks contributed by filing issues, asking questions and making suggestions.
 
Features

 * TestCentric relies on the NUnit engine to load and run tests. Features that require 
 an engine extension are only available if the appropriate extension is installed. In
 particular, this includes the ability to open both NUnit and Visual Studio projects,
 run NUNit V2 tests and save results in V2 format.
 
 * All direct access to NUnit project contents, such as editing, saving and adding
 configurations, has been removed. The user should use a separate editor such as
 the NUnit Project Editor to perform those tasks.

 * Because the GUI runs under .NET 4.5 or higher, any tests that you cause to execute
 in-process will run under that version of the framework. In some cases, this may give
 different results. By default, tests are run in a separate process and use the target
 framework for which they were built. We recommend you stick with the default.

 * The File menu no longer has entries for Load Fixture or Clear Fixture. New menu 
 items to select Process and AppDomain options for loading have been added and the
 corresponding Settings pages removed.

 * The Project top level menu has been removed since it was mostly used to contain
 entries related to NUnit projects. The "Add Projects" entry has been replaced by 
 "Add Files" on the File menu.

 * The Tools menu no longer has entries for Exception Details or Test Assemblies. 
 The Open Log Directory entry has been replaced with Open Work Directory.

 * The Result Tabs (Errors and Failures, Tests Not Run, and Text Output) may no 
 longer be hidden. The Text Output tab only displays Console output and the ability 
 to tailor it's contents has been removed with the exception of the option to label
 tests by name in various ways.

 * Version 0.15 of the Experimental GUI is included.

Known Problems

 * TestCentric uses the test id to select individual tests to be run. This is not 
 currently supported by the V2 framework driver, which throws an exception when 
 an id filter is encountered. The result for the GUI is that it is not possible
 to select individual tests for execution if any V2 framework tests are loaded.
 For that reason, we recommend that you only use this release for NUnit 3 tests.
 This problem will be fixed when a new version of the V2 driver is available,
 which includes support for an id filter.

Issues Resolved

 * 7 Credit for all contributors
 * 8 Icon and Logo for TestCentric
 * 224 FIXED: Appveyor build doesn't use generated identifier to tag packages 
 * 375 Clean up GUI About box
 * 378 Ensure that error message displays when exception is thrown in engine

TestCentric Runner for NUnit 1.0.0-Beta4 - July 17, 2019

General

This is the fourth beta release of the TestCentric Runner for NUnit. While it is still beta,
it is feature-complete. Since the actual execution of tests is done by the NUnit engine
rather than the GUI itself, it's probably reasonable for developers to use this on the
desktop, provided their CI is based on a stable production-level NUnit runner, such as
the NUnit 3 Console Runner or the NUnit 3 VS adapter.

Features

 * Version 0.14 of the Experimental GUI is included.

Issues Resolved

 * 368 FIXED: Arguments to --process option for GUI don't match NUnit console.
 * 369 Merge Options classes for two GUIs and move to common assembly.
 * 370 FIXED: Beta3: unhandled .net exception

Features

 * Version 0.13 of the Experimental GUI is included.
 * Added command-line options --process, --domain, --inprocess, --x86 and --agents.

TestCentric Runner for NUnit 1.0.0-Alpha1 - August 3, 2018

General

This is the initial alpha release of the TestCentric Runner for NUnit. It is not yet recommended
for use in production work.

Features

This GUI runner resembles the NUnit V2 GUI, but since it runs NUnit 3 tests the internal implementation
is entirely new. In addition, features not available or not easily supported in NUnit 3 have been
removed. Some key differences from the V2 GUI are...

 * The GUI itself targets .NET 4.5, rather than 2.0.
 * We use chocolatey as the primary distribution method for the GUI. This makes extensions that are
 also installed through chocolatey available when running under the GUI. A zip file is also provided.
 * Displaying tests as a flat list of fixtures is not supported.
 * Merging tests in the same namespace across assemblies is not supported.
 * The GUI no longer understands the layout of NUnit project files, which is taken care of by the 
 NUnit test engine. Consequently, menu items relating to creating, editiong and saving such files 
 are no longer present.
 * The ability to open project files, including NUnit and VS projects, is dependent on the presence
 of the approprate engine extensions, which are not bundled with the GUI.
